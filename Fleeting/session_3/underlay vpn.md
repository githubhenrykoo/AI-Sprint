## How Underlay VPN Works

### üéØ **Primary Purpose**
Traditional VPN services focus on:
- **Privacy**: Hide your real IP address and location
- **Security**: Encrypt all internet traffic  
- **Access**: Bypass geo-restrictions and censorship
- **Anonymity**: Prevent tracking by ISPs, governments, and websites

### üìã **Traffic Flow Process**

1. **Without VPN**
   - You ‚Üí ISP ‚Üí Target Website
   - ISP can see all your browsing activity
   - Websites see your real IP and location
   - Government/ISP can monitor and log traffic

2. **With VPN**
   - You ‚Üí Encrypted Tunnel ‚Üí VPN Server ‚Üí Target Website
   - ISP only sees encrypted data to VPN server
   - Websites see VPN server IP, not yours
   - Your real location and identity are hidden

### üîç **What VPN Providers Actually Do**

#### **Infrastructure Management**
- **Global Server Network**: Thousands of servers worldwide
  - SurfShark: 3,200+ servers in 100+ countries
  - NordVPN: 5,400+ servers in 60+ countries
  - ExpressVPN: 3,000+ servers in 94+ countries

- **Server Operations**
  - Maintain physical and virtual servers
  - Ensure high-speed connections
  - Manage server load balancing
  - Handle security updates and patches

#### **Core Services Provided**

### 1. **Traffic Encryption & Tunneling**
- **AES-256 encryption** for all data transmission
- **Secure protocols**: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec
- **DNS leak protection** to prevent identity exposure
- **Kill switch** functionality (disconnects if VPN fails)

### 2. **IP Address Masking & Location Spoofing**
- Hide your real IP address from websites
- Provide shared IP addresses for anonymity
- Allow selection of exit server location
- Dynamic IP rotation for enhanced privacy

### 3. **Geo-Restriction Bypass**
- Access region-locked content (Netflix US, BBC iPlayer, etc.)
- Circumvent internet censorship in restrictive countries
- Bypass workplace/school network restrictions
- Access blocked social media platforms

### 4. **Privacy Protection**
- **No-logs policies** (don't store user activity data)
- **Anonymous payment options** (cryptocurrency, cash)
- **RAM-only servers** (data wiped on restart)
- **Independent security audits** to verify claims

## VPN Provider Business Models

### üè¢ **How They Make Money**

#### **Subscription-Based Revenue**

## Comparison with Other Technologies

### üÜö **Underlay VPN vs Overlay VPN**

| Aspect | **Underlay VPN** (SurfShark) | **Overlay VPN** (ZeroTier) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Privacy, security, anonymity | Connect specific devices |
| **Traffic Scope** | ALL internet traffic | Only between network members |
| **Location Impact** | Hide/change apparent location | Location doesn't matter |
| **Primary Use** | Browse privately, bypass geo-blocks | Remote access, file sharing |
| **Connection Model** | You ‚Üî VPN Server ‚Üî Internet | Device ‚Üî Device (P2P) |
| **Cost Model** | Monthly subscription per user | Often free for small networks |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple app installation | Network configuration required |
| **Performance** | Slight latency increase | Often faster (direct connections) |

### üîÑ **Underlay VPN vs Proxy Services**

| Feature | **VPN** | **Proxy** |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Encryption** | Yes, full traffic encryption | No, just forwarding |
| **Application Support** | All applications | Browser/specific apps only |
| **Security Level** | High | Basic |
| **Speed** | Moderate overhead | Minimal overhead |
| **Privacy** | Strong | Limited |

## Limitations and Considerations

2. **Strong encryption** and modern protocols
3. **Server locations** in desired countries
4. **Connection speed** and reliability
5. **Customer support** quality
