# Sessions 7, 8, 9: Team Project Development Activity Guide

## **Sessions Overview**
**Sessions**: 7, 8, 9 (All identical development sessions)
**Objective**: Implement planned autonomous systems from Session 6, integrating all learned concepts into working prototypes

## **Learning Objectives**
- Implement planned autonomous systems from Session 6
- Integrate IoT, PKC, Telegram, and BMAD Method components into cohesive systems
- Practice team collaboration and project management
- Achieve progressive integration of all learned concepts into working prototypes

---

## **What Students Will Learn**
- Hands-on project implementation
- Component integration (IoT, PKC, Telegram, BMAD)
- Autonomous system development
- Consensus mechanism implementation
- Testing and debugging techniques
- Team collaboration and coordination
- Progress documentation and reporting

## **Project Rules**
- Teams must work on their planned projects from Session 6
- All components must be integrated and functional
- Consensus mechanisms must be tested and working
- Progress must be documented daily in GitHub
- Teams must help each other when needed
- All code must be properly commented and documented

## **Prerequisites**
- **Session 6 Completion**: Project planning and BMAD Method setup must be complete
- **Technical Stack Ready**: IoT (Session 3), PKC (Session 2), Integration (Session 4), BMAD (Session 5)
- **Team Infrastructure**: GitHub repository and team collaboration tools functional

## **Development Tools Integration**

### **NotebookLM for Development Knowledge Management**
- **Technical Documentation**: Upload and organize all technical documentation for AI-assisted reference
- **Troubleshooting Assistant**: Use AI to help debug integration issues and find solutions
- **Code Documentation**: Generate and maintain comprehensive code documentation
- **Learning Resource**: Create shared knowledge base for complex technical concepts
- **Integration Guidance**: Get AI assistance for connecting IoT, PKC, Telegram, and BMAD components
- **Best Practices**: Research and implement coding standards and architectural patterns
