# Session 5: BMAD Method & Prompt Engineering Activity Guide

## **Session Overview**
**Objective**: Learn BMAD Method fundamentals, prompt engineering basics, and create PRD documents using AI agents

## **What Students Will Learn**
- BMAD Method fundamentals and concepts
- Prompt engineering techniques and best practices
- What is a PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Story Master, Developer, and QA agent roles
- Agentic workflow orchestration basics
- Integration of BMAD Method with IoT-PKC systems

## **Project Rules**
- All teams must implement BMAD Method in their projects
- Each team must have Story Master, Developer, and QA agents configured
- Teams must create a PRD document using AI agents
- All prompts must follow engineering best practices
- BMAD workflows must integrate with existing IoT-PKC systems
- Documentation must track all agent interactions and decisions

## **Key Concepts**

### **BMAD Method Basics**
- **B**usiness requirements and user stories
- **M**odel architecture and system design
- **A**gent orchestration and workflow management
- **D**eployment and testing strategies

### **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals**
- Clear and specific prompt construction
- Context setting and role definition
- Input-output formatting
- Error handling in prompts
- Iterative prompt refinement

### **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
- Purpose and importance of PRDs
- Key sections and components
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Success metrics and validation criteria

### **AI Agent Roles**
- **Story Master**: Defines user stories and business requirements
- **Developer**: Creates technical architecture and implementation plans
- **QA**: Validates requirements and tests system functionality

## **Tools Integration**

### **NotebookLM for PRD Development**
- **Research Synthesis**: Use NotebookLM to research and compile requirements from multiple sources
- **AI-Assisted Writing**: Leverage AI to help draft PRD sections and user stories
- **Team Collaboration**: Share NotebookLM notebooks for collaborative PRD development
- **Source Grounding**: Ensure all PRD content is grounded in research and team discussions
- **Documentation Quality**: Use AI assistance to improve clarity and completeness of technical requirements
