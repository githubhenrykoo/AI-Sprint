   - Description: "BBS AI Hackathon 2025 - Meta-Narrative Framework Project"
   - Set to Public for collaboration and showcase
   - Initialize with README, .gitignore, and MIT License

2. **Team Member Access**: Add all team members as collaborators
   - Each member gets Write access to repository
   - Configure branch protection rules for main branch
   - Set up pull request requirements

3. **Repository Structure Setup**:
   ```
   hackathon-2025-[team-name]/

   - Calendar name: "BBS Hackathon 2025 - Team [Name]"
   - Description: "Shared team coordination and milestone tracking"
   - Time zone: Local hackathon timezone
   - **Important**: This is ONE calendar shared by ALL team members

2. **Team Member Access Configuration**:
   - **Add ALL team members** with "Make changes and manage sharing" permissions
   - Each team member can view, edit, and add events
   - All team members receive notifications for calendar events
   - Add trainers with "See all event details" permissions (view-only)
   - Share calendar link in team GitHub repository

3. **Calendar Sharing Verification**:
   - Verify each team member can access the shared calendar
   - Test that all members can add and edit events
   - Confirm notifications are working for all team members
   - Ensure calendar appears in each member's Google Calendar app

3. **Initial Event Setup**:
   - **Daily Sessions**: Add all hackathon session times
   - **Team Meetings**: Schedule daily standup times
   - **Milestone Deadlines**: Add key project milestones
   - **Consensus Meetings**: Schedule team decision-making sessions

4. **Calendar Integration**:

- **Conflict Prevention**: Team can see when members are busy or available
- **Milestone Tracking**: Shared visibility of project deadlines and progress

**Calendar Usage Guidelines**:
- **Team Events Only**: Use shared calendar for team-related activities only
- **Clear Event Titles**: Use descriptive names like "Team Alpha Daily Standup" or "PKC Integration Deadline"
- **Event Descriptions**: Include relevant details, links, and agenda items
- **Notification Settings**: Configure appropriate notification timing for different event types
- **Regular Updates**: Keep calendar current with any schedule changes or new deadlines

**Calendar Permissions Structure**:
- **Team Members**: Full edit access (can create, modify, delete events)
- **Trainers**: View-only access (can see team schedule for support)
- **Calendar Owner**: Team Consensus Coordinator (manages sharing settings)

#### **Team Communication Channels**
Establish primary communication methods:

**Communication Setup**:
1. **GitHub Issues**: For technical discussions and task tracking
2. **GitHub Discussions**: For team coordination and decision-making
3. **Telegram Group**: For real-time communication during hackathon
4. **Google Calendar**: For scheduling and deadline management

**Communication Protocols**:
- **Daily Updates**: Post progress in GitHub repository
- **Decision Making**: Use GitHub Discussions for consensus
- **Urgent Issues**: Use Telegram for immediate communication
- **Documentation**: All decisions and outcomes recorded in GitHub

### **Individual Learning Documentation Framework**
