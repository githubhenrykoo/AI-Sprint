# Session 2: PKC Integration with Meta-Narrative & Agentic Workflows Activity Guide

## **Session Overview**
**Objective**: Deploy PKC as computational governance system, catch up on online session requirements, and introduce BMAD Method integration

## **Session Structure**

### **Track A: PKC Deployment & Catch-up (Students who haven't completed online sessions)**
### **Track B: Advanced BMAD Method Integration (Students who completed online work)**

---

## **What Students Will Learn**
- PKC installation and configuration
- Basic PKC operations
- Team workspace setup
- User account and permission management
- Version control basics
- System verification and troubleshooting

## **Project Rules**
- Each team must have a working PKC instance
- All team members must have PKC access
- Team workspace must be properly organized
- All project documentation goes in PKC

---

## **Track B: BMAD Method Introduction**

### **What Students Will Learn**
- BMAD Method concepts and fundamentals
- Introduction to Story Master, Developer, and QA agent roles
- Understanding agentic workflow principles
- Overview of consensus mechanisms
- Governance framework concepts
- How BMAD Method will integrate with PKC systems

### **Project Rules**
- Students must understand BMAD Method concepts
- Teams must identify which members will work with each agent type
- Basic understanding of agentic workflows must be demonstrated
- Students must understand how BMAD will connect to their PKC setup
- No implementation required in this session - concepts only

## **Assessment Criteria**

### **Track A Success Metrics**
{{ ... }}
- [ ] GovTech directory structure properly configured
- [ ] Basic PKC operations functional
- [ ] Team collaboration workspace established
- [ ] GitHub repository created and configured
- [ ] Team members added as collaborators

### **Track B Success Metrics**
- [ ] BMAD Method concepts understood
- [ ] Agent roles (Story Master, Developer, QA) clearly explained
- [ ] Agentic workflow principles comprehended
- [ ] Understanding of how BMAD will integrate with PKC
- [ ] Team members assigned to future agent roles
- [ ] Preparation for BMAD implementation in Session 5

### **Universal Success Metrics (All Students)**
- [ ] Individual GitHub account with SSH keys configured
- [ ] Team repository following Meta-Narrative Framework structure
- [ ] Team charter and governance documents committed
- [ ] Collaborative workflow tested and functional
- [ ] Repository integrated with PKC configuration

## **Materials Required**

### **For All Students**
- Laptops with Docker installed
- Git configured with SSH keys
- GitHub account (created during session if needed)
- PKC repository access
- BMAD Method installation packages
- School email address for GitHub Education benefits

### **For Trainers**
- PKC deployment troubleshooting guides
- BMAD Method configuration templates
- GovTech directory structure examples
- GitHub repository templates and examples
- Integration testing checklists
- SSH key troubleshooting guides

## **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **PKC Deployment Issues**
- **Port conflicts**: Use alternative ports (9353, 9354, etc.)
- **Docker permissions**: Ensure user in docker group
- **Database connection**: Verify PostgreSQL container health
- **Memory issues**: Increase Docker memory allocation

### **BMAD Integration Issues**
- **Node.js version**: Ensure compatible version (16+)
- **Network connectivity**: Check firewall settings
- **Agent communication**: Verify port configurations
- **PKC authentication**: Confirm API tokens

### **GitHub Setup Issues**
- **SSH key problems**: Verify key is added to ssh-agent and GitHub
- **Permission denied**: Check SSH key permissions (600 for private key)
- **Repository access**: Ensure team members accepted collaboration invitations
- **Git configuration**: Verify global user.name and user.email are set
- **Branch protection**: May need to temporarily disable for initial setup

## **Expected Outcomes**

By the end of Session 2, all students will have:
1. **Functional PKC deployment** configured as governance system
2. **GovTech directory structure** ready for Meta-Narrative work
3. **BMAD Method integration** (advanced students) or understanding (catch-up students)
4. **GitHub team repository** with proper Meta-Narrative Framework structure
5. **Collaborative development workflow** established with team members
6. **API integrations** (Google, Telegram) configured and tested
7. **Team synchronization** with common technical foundation
8. **Readiness for Day 2** IoT integration and advanced workflows

## **Transition to Session 3**
Teams are now prepared for Session 3 where they will:
- Integrate IoT devices with PKC governance systems
- Apply Conversational Programming to physical-digital bridges
- Implement resource-aware computation patterns
- Begin autonomous system development
