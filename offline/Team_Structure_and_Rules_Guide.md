# Team Structure and Rules Guide

## **Team Structure & Rules**

### **Team Composition**
- **Team Size**: 4-5 students per team
- **Roles per Team**:
  - **Narrative Architect**: Designs story structure and Meta-Narrative flow
  - **Technical Lead**: Handles PKC integration and IoT implementation

  - **Consensus Coordinator**: Manages team governance and validation processes
  - **Cultural Integrator**: Ensures cultural sensitivity and knowledge integration

### **Team Formation Rules (Trainer-Assigned)**
1. **Skill Balance**: Trainers ensure each team has mixed skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
2. **Cognitive Compatibility**: Trainers form teams based on Conversational Programming assessment results
3. **No Self-Selection**: Students do not choose their own teams - all assignments made by trainers

## **Team Rules**
- Teams are assigned by trainers (no self-selection)
- Each team has 4-5 students with mixed skill levels
- All team members must contribute to documentation
- Teams must use consensus for major decisions

- Seek trainer support when needed

## **Team Documentation Templates**

### **Strengths Documentation Template**
Teams should document each member's strengths using this structure:

#### **Individual Member Documentation**
- **Technical Strengths**: Programming languages, hardware experience, software tools, development experience
- **Soft Skills**: Communication, problem solving, collaboration, learning style
- **Domain Knowledge**: AI/ML experience, IoT knowledge, web development, project management
- **Personal Interests**: Technology areas, learning goals, teaching strengths, creative skills
- **Availability & Preferences**: Time availability, work style, communication preferences, stress management

### **Project Component Responsibility Matrix**
Teams should create a matrix identifying who is responsible for each project component:

#### **Core Project Components**
- **IoT & Hardware (ESP32, Sensors)**: Primary and secondary responsible members
- **PKC Integration & Governance**: Primary and secondary responsible members
- **Telegram Bot & Communication**: Primary and secondary responsible members
- **BMAD Method & Agentic Workflows**: Primary and secondary responsible members
- **Meta-Narrative Framework & Cultural Integration**: Primary and secondary responsible members

#### **Cross-Cutting Responsibilities**
- **Documentation & Presentation**: Primary responsible with all members contributing
- **Testing & Quality Assurance**: Primary responsible with all members contributing
- **Project Management & Coordination**: Primary responsible with all members contributing

### **Team Mission Statement**
Teams should create a mission statement incorporating:
- Technical objectives (PKC, IoT, BMAD integration)
- Cultural integration goals
- Learning and teaching objectives
- Consensus and governance principles
