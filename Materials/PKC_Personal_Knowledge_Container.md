# PKC (Personal Knowledge Container)

## What is PKC?

**Personal Knowledge Container (PKC)** is a local-first, AI-powered knowledge management system that gives you complete control over your personal data while providing intelligent assistance and insights.

## Core Concept

PKC transforms your digital life into a unified, AI-accessible knowledge base that:
- Runs entirely on your device
- Integrates data from multiple sources
- Provides AI-powered insights and assistance
- Maintains complete privacy and user control

## Key Principles

### 1. Data Sovereignty
- **You own your data** - No external company controls your information
- **You control access** - Decide what data to include and how it's used
- **You set the rules** - Configure the system according to your needs

### 2. Local-First Architecture
- **Offline functionality** - Works without internet connection
- **Local processing** - AI runs on your device, not in the cloud
- **Sync when available** - Optional cloud backup and sync
- **Device independence** - Your data isn't trapped on one platform

### 3. Interoperability
- **Multi-platform integration** - Connect Google, Notion, files, emails, etc.
- **Open standards** - Uses standard formats and protocols
- **API connectivity** - Integrate with any service that provides APIs
- **Format agnostic** - Works with documents, databases, media, etc.

### 4. Verifiability
- **Change tracking** - All modifications are logged and traceable
- **Version control** - Maintain history of all changes
- **Audit trails** - Know when, how, and why data changed
- **Data integrity** - Verify authenticity and completeness

### 5. Context Preservation
- **Relationship maintenance** - Preserve connections between information
- **Temporal context** - Understand when and how information evolved
- **Source attribution** - Know where information came from
- **Cross-reference capabilities** - Find related information automatically

### Data Flow Process
1. **Ingestion** - Import data from various sources (files, APIs, manual entry)
2. **Processing** - Extract, clean, and index information
3. **Storage** - Store locally with metadata and relationships
4. **Retrieval** - Search and find relevant information for queries
5. **Generation** - Use local AI to synthesize responses and insights
6. **Presentation** - Display results in user-friendly format
