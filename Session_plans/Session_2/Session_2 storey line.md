# Session 2: PKC, Git & Integration - Key Points

## 1. PKC Implementation
- Implementation structure (folder hierarchy, components)
- Local environment setup and dependencies
- Key configuration files and their purposes
- Runtime architecture and dataflow
- Development workflow and deployment pipeline

## 2. Continuous Integration in PKC
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Automated testing and validation pipeline
- CI/CD principles applied to knowledge management
- Version tracking and automated deployment
- Feedback loops and quality gates

## 3. Git Integration & Open Source
- Using Git to access PKC resources
- Command-line demonstration: `git clone`, etc.
- Integration with existing open-source projects:
  - **ThingsBoard** (IoT management): https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard
  - **Langfuse** (LLM observability): https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse
- Reuse vs. rebuild philosophy

## 3. MVP Cards as Integration Tools
- **MCard**: Universal connector
  - Content-addressable storage (like Git)
  - Immutable data preservation
  - Integration points with external systems
- **PCard**: Workflow engine
  - Processing rules for external data
  - Conversational interfaces to external tools
  - Feedback loops with integrated systems
- **VCard**: Security framework
  - Access control for integrated components
  - Verifiable credentials across systems
  - Audit capabilities for cross-system interactions

## 4. CLM Framework & Hyperlinks
- Three dimensions for knowledge verification:
  - Abstract Specification (want)
  - Concrete Implementation (have)
  - Balanced Expectations (expect)
- Hyperlinks as continuation mechanism
- Parallel between Git's hash system and MCard

## 5. AI Augmentation
- AI as enhancement, not replacement
- Automatic content generation
- Connection discovery via semantic search

## 6. Continuous Evolution
- Collaborative, version-controlled knowledge
- Adapting to new challenges
- System that grows with user needs
