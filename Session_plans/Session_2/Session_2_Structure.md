# Session 2: PKC, Git, and Continuous Integration

* **PKC: Knowledge Operating System**
  * Knowledge management OS and "super app"
  * Everything as a Card
  * Self-sovereign data control

* **MVP Cards Architecture**
  * **MCard (Data Plane):** Atomic knowledge units with content-addressable hash
  * **PCard (Control Plane):** Conversational programming with interactive testing
  * **VCard (Application Plane):** Value exchange boundaries with authentication
  * Mathematical foundations with arithmetic logic and polynomial functors
  * Integration with IPFS and libP2P for distributed content

* **Cubical Logic Model (CLM)**
  * Knowledge correctness sandbox
  * Three dimensions: Abstract Specification, Concrete Implementation, Balanced Expectations
  * Ensures data is socially and physically correct
  * "A story is a logic model that is worth to be continued"
  * Validation through machine execution and human-annotated logs

* **Git & Continuous Integration**
  * Git for project collaboration and distributed version control
  * Pull PKC with Git
  * Built-in CI/CD pipeline for knowledge components
  * Leverage open-source with unified framework
  * "Continuous" means "doing something next" with real-time feedback

* **Hyperlinks & Continuation**
  * Mechanism for "continuation" and "next"
  * PKC as a hyperlink management tool
  * State management (like Redux) for system coherence
  * Every action embodies "next" through hyperlinks

* **Security & Self-Sovereignty**
  * VCard enforces boundaries with rigorous arithmetic logic
  * Integration with HSMs, biometric authentication, and JWTs
  * Quantifiable security guarantees
  * Accountability through identity verification

* **AI & Machine Learning Integration**
  * Localized LLM fine-tuning with user data control
  * Automatic MCard content generation
  * Conversational interfaces for PCard
  * Semantic search via vector embeddings
