## Detailed Agenda

### 1. Brief Review of Session 1 Topics

#### Activities:
- **Session 1 Recap**
  - Review key concepts: AI, LLMs, PKC principles, IoT
  - Quick discussion: "What stuck with you from last session?"
  - Connect to today's focus on PKC vs NotebookLM comparison

#### Interactive Element:
- Quick round: Each participant mentions one thing they remember from Session 1

---

### 2. Demonstration of NotebookLM

#### Activities:
- **Live NotebookLM Demo**
  - Creating a new notebook
  - Uploading documents (PDFs, text files)
  - Asking questions about uploaded content
  - Showing citation features

#### Interactive Element:
- **Give participants time to try NotebookLM themselves**
- Let them upload their own documents and ask questions
- Share discoveries with the group

### 3. Brief Explanation of NotebookLM

#### Activities:
- **NotebookLM Advantages/Disadvantages**
  - Easy to use, Google integration
  - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach
  - **Needs to be online** (internet dependency)
  - Limited to ~50 documents
  - Cloud-based processing

---

### 4. Brief Explanation of What PKC Can Do Better

#### Activities:
- **Scale Comparison**
  - NotebookLM: 10-20 documents limit
  - **PKC: 200-300 different sources**
  - Much larger knowledge base capacity
  - Multiple data types (not just documents)

---

### 5. Demonstration of PKC

#### Activities:
- **Live PKC Demo**
  - Show PKC with extensive knowledge base (200-300 sources)
  - Same questions asked to both NotebookLM and PKC
  - Compare response quality and source diversity
  - Demonstrate offline functionality
  - Show local data processing

#### Interactive Element:
- Side-by-side comparison queries
- **Let participants know they will be able to do this in the hackathon**

### 6. Brief Explanation of Local-First Principles + Data Sovereignty

#### Activities:
- **Local-First Principles**
  - Your data stays on YOUR device
  - Works offline (no internet dependency)
  - You control your data completely
  - No vendor lock-in

- **Data Sovereignty**
  - You own your personal information
  - Protection from service discontinuation
  - Privacy from surveillance and tracking
  - Personal data as personal asset

#### Interactive Element:
- Quick discussion: "What data do you create daily that you'd want to control?"

---

### 7. Brief Summary of Session 2

#### Activities:
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - NotebookLM is powerful but limited (internet dependency, ~50 document limit)
  - PKC offers much greater scale (200-300+ sources) and local control
  - Local-first principles give you data ownership and privacy
  - PKC works offline, NotebookLM requires internet

#### Preparation for Session 3:
- **Tools Needed for Session 3:**
  - **ZeroTier Account Creation**
    - Go to zerotier.com
    - Create free account
    - Download ZeroTier client for your operating system
    - Install but don't configure yet

#### Interactive Element:
- Quick feedback: "What surprised you most about the PKC vs NotebookLM comparison?"

---

## Materials Needed:
- NotebookLM access for all participants
- PKC environment with 200-300 sources for comparison
- Sample documents for both demonstrations
- ZeroTier installation files
- Comparison examples showing scale differences

---

## Success Metrics:
- Participants understand NotebookLM limitations (internet, scale)
- Participants see PKC advantages (scale, offline, local control)
- Participants grasp local-first and data sovereignty concepts
- Participants ready for ZeroTier setup for Session 3
