| ESP32 | Basic data collection and control flows with example firmware; integrate sensor readings into PKC. |
| Arduino (hardware & IDE) | Upload and run reference sketches; serial data to PKC for logging/analysis. |
| Telegram | Chatbot interface for querying PKC content and triggering simple actions. |
| WhatsApp | Basic conversational access to PKC via integration bridge. |
| Jupyter Notebook | Local notebooks for exploration, demos, and PKC API usage. |

| Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Use MCP-compatible tools to extend PKC with local actions and integrations. |
| RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | Index your sources and chat with them using baseline retrieval and prompting. |
| LLM Features | Local or API-based chat/completion, basic summarization and Q&A. |
| User-defined Features (Extensibility) | Self-hosted users can add their own features/integrations (e.g., via MCP tools, plugins, or custom services). For deployments hosted by us, additional features are distributed via a managed add-on store. |

Notes
- PKC is extensible by default. Self-hosted users fully control custom features. Hosted deployments use a curated add-on store for safe, managed extensions.
