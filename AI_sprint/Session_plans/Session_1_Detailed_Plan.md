### 2. PKC Definition & Core Concept (15 minutes)

#### Activities:

##### A. Define PKC Clearly
- **PKC stands for "Personal Knowledge Container"** (definitive - not "Progressive")
- "Personal" means it can support both individual work AND collaboration/group work
- Clear, simple definition that everyone can understand

##### B. How PKC Works - The "Box" Analogy
- **PKC is an accumulation and integration of existing, available, and free tools found on the internet**
- Use the "**box**" analogy:
  - PKC provides the "box" (system/framework)
  - Users pick and choose which tools to put inside the box
  - Tools then appear as integrated menus
  - Our team has integrated 5 tools for demonstration
  - Users can choose their own tools later

##### C. Real-World Examples and Dialogues
- **Interactive scenarios**: How Lena manages her time, how someone does research
- Show personal relevance through concrete examples
- Demonstrate tool integration based on individual needs

#### Interactive Elements:
- Ask audience: "Do anyone have an idea what [PKC principles] is about?"
- "Have you ever used an AI tool before?"
- Create dialogue between presenters - if something is technical, pause and ask for simple explanation

---

### 3. PKC Principles Explained Simply (15 minutes)

#### Activities:

##### A. Three Core PKC Principles
**Explain using simple, easy-to-understand examples (especially for high school students):**

**1. Local First Principle**
- AI and all databases run locally on YOUR computer
- Nobody else can access your data
- Works offline - no internet dependency
- Local LLM (Large Language Model) processes your information
- IoT device interaction for real-time data from local hardware

**2. Single Source of Truth**
- Merges everything into one "super app"
- Avoid switching between many tools (ChatGPT, Google Drive, Cloud, etc.)
- When there's conflicting information: system identifies conflicts and mentions them
- **USER decides** what information is correct (system doesn't assume local data is always right)
- Goal: unified access to all your information

**3. Self-Sovereign Data Assets**
- Makes ALL your data valuable, even old or seemingly useless files
- Helps find relevant information in large volumes (like textbooks)
- You retain control over your identity data
- Data stored securely and locally
- Transform old documents into searchable, useful resources

##### B. "Personal" in PKC
- Supports individual work AND collaboration
- Group work capabilities will be learned later in hackathon
- Collaboration is actively promoted and supported

#### Interactive Elements:
- Ask for examples from their daily digital challenges
- "What tools do you currently switch between?"
- "Have you ever lost important files or information?"

---

### 4. Key Tools & LLM Role (10 minutes)

#### Activities:

##### A. Main Tools for Basic Functionality
**Key Tools Needed:**
- **Docker**: "Docker is something that enables us to integrate some of these tools" (brief, simple explanation)
- **Ollama**: Local AI processing
- **GitHub**: Code and collaboration management
- **Windsurf**: Code editor (mention: "just a code editor, users can use Visual Studio Code or others")

**Integration Tools:**
- Notion, Calendar, Google Docs
- These integrate INTO the PKC "box"
- Users choose which tools to add based on their needs

##### B. LLM Role Clarification
- **LLM is only ONE of many AI features** in PKC
- Acts as the "**conversational driver**"
- Interfaces and integrates various tools
- Enables automated and intelligent processes
- NOT the whole system - just one component

##### C. Avoid Overwhelming Technical Terms
- Assure audience that terms like "Docker" and "Windsurf" will be explained simply as they progress
- Focus on concepts, not technical details
- Emphasize: "You don't need to understand the technical details to use PKC"

#### Interactive Elements:
- "What tools do you currently use for work/study?"
- "How would you like these tools to work together?"

### 5. Enhanced PKC Demonstration (12 minutes)

---

#### Activities:

##### A. PKC vs NotebookLM Comparison
**Highlight Key Differences:**
- **No document source limit** (NotebookLM limited to 50 documents)
- **Runs locally** ("local first") - keeps data on your computer
- **Full integration** with other tools and services
- **Personal control** over all data and processing

##### B. Multi-Document Analysis Demo
- Demonstrate PKC analyzing multiple documents simultaneously
- **Show which parts of answers come from different documents**
- Highlight cross-document connections and insights
- Compare with traditional single-document tools

##### C. Interactive Live Demo
- **Invite participants to send their own PDF documents** for live demonstration
- Use Google Drive link for document submission
- Show real-time analysis of participant-provided content
- Demonstrate personalized responses based on their documents

##### D. Google Calendar Integration
- **Natural language queries** to retrieve calendar information
- Example: "Find me an appointment with Stefanos in the past three months"
- Show integration with widely-used, free tools
- Demonstrate seamless tool integration

##### E. IoT Device Demonstration (guided by Dewey)
- Brief IoT introduction
- Show previous project's IoT devices:
  - Energy meter, humidity sensor, air quality
  - GPS tracker, temperature, light control
- Hosted on test.bkc.pub
- Explain how AI processes this IoT data locally
- Demonstrate real-time data integration

#### Interactive Elements:
- Live document analysis with participant materials
- Calendar query suggestions from audience
- IoT device interaction and questions

## What NOT to Talk About / Defer to Later Sessions

### Avoid in Session 1:
- **Overwhelming technical terms early on** - assure participants these will be explained simply later
- **Deep dives into advanced tools** like Napper and Zero Tier - mention these will be covered in future sessions
- **Complex architecture details** - focus on concepts and benefits
- **Detailed coding or technical implementation** - emphasize no coding background needed
- **Advanced troubleshooting scenarios** - keep focus on possibilities and benefits

### Save for Later Sessions:
- Detailed tool configuration
- Advanced integration patterns
- Technical troubleshooting
- Complex use case scenarios
- In-depth security and privacy technical details
