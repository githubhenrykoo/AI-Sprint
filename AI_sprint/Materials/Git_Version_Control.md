# Git (Version Control)

## What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple people. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development, Git has become the de facto standard for version control in software development and beyond.

Unlike centralized version control systems, Git gives every developer a complete copy of the project history, enabling offline work and providing redundancy against server failures. This distributed nature makes Git incredibly robust and flexible, supporting various workflows from simple solo projects to complex enterprise development with hundreds of contributors.

Git excels at managing text-based files (code, documentation, configuration files) but can also track binary files. Its sophisticated branching and merging capabilities allow teams to work on multiple features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

## Why Version Control Matters

### The Problem Without Version Control
```
Document.txt
Document_final.txt
Document_final_v2.txt
Document_final_v2_revised.txt
Document_final_v2_revised_FINAL.txt
Document_final_v2_revised_FINAL_THIS_ONE.txt
```

**Issues:**
- Which version is actually current?
- What changed between versions?
- How do multiple people collaborate?
- What if you need to go back to an earlier version?
- How do you merge changes from different people?

### Git Solution
- **Complete History** - Every change is tracked and reversible
- **Branching** - Work on features independently, then merge
- **Collaboration** - Multiple people can work simultaneously
- **Backup** - Distributed nature provides automatic backups
- **Accountability** - Know who changed what and when

## Core Git Concepts

### Repository (Repo)
- **Definition** - A project folder tracked by Git
- **Contains** - All files, folders, and complete change history
- **Local** - Repository on your computer
- **Remote** - Repository on a server (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

### Commits
- **Definition** - Snapshots of your project at specific points in time
- **Immutable** - Once created, commits cannot be changed
- **Linked** - Each commit points to its parent(s)
- **Identified** - Unique hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d4...`)

### Branches
- **Definition** - Independent lines of development
- **Main/Master** - Primary branch of the project
- **Feature Branches** - Separate branches for new features
- **Parallel Work** - Multiple branches can exist simultaneously

### Working Directory, Staging, and Repository
```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository
     (edit)          (add)         (commit)
```

## Basic Git Workflow

### Setting Up Git
```bash
# Configure your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone existing repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Daily Git Commands
```bash
# Check status of files
git status

# Add files to staging
git add filename.txt
git add .  # Add all files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# View commit history
git log
git log --oneline  # Compact view

# Check differences
git diff           # Unstaged changes
git diff --staged  # Staged changes
```

### Working with Branches
```bash
# List branches
git branch

# Create new branch
git branch feature-name

# Switch to branch
git checkout feature-name
# or (newer syntax)
git switch feature-name

# Create and switch in one command
git checkout -b feature-name

# Merge branch into current branch
git merge feature-name

# Delete branch
git branch -d feature-name
```

## Git in Development Projects

### Project Management
- **Documentation** - Version control reading materials and documentation
- **Configuration Files** - Track changes to system configurations
- **Scripts and Code** - Version control automation scripts and code
- **Collaborative Development** - Multiple contributors to projects

### Common Project Types
- **Documentation Projects** - Managing technical writing and guides
- **Configuration Management** - Tracking system and application configs
- **Script Development** - Version controlling automation and setup scripts
- **Learning Materials** - Organizing and tracking educational content

## Git Best Practices

### Commit Messages
```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add API authentication documentation"
git commit -m "Fix database connection timeout issue"
git commit -m "Update installation guide with troubleshooting steps"

# Poor commit messages
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "asdfgh"
```

### Commit Frequency
- **Small, Focused Commits** - Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Regular Commits** - Commit frequently to avoid losing work
- **Working State** - Only commit when code/files are in working state
- **Atomic Commits** - Each commit should be complete and functional

### Branch Strategy
```
main/master
├── feature/documentation-update
├── feature/api-integration
├── bugfix/configuration-fix
└── docs/user-guides
```

## Git for Non-Programmers

### Documentation Projects
- **Track Changes** - See exactly what changed in documents
- **Collaboration** - Multiple people can edit simultaneously
- **Version History** - Access any previous version
- **Branching** - Work on different versions independently

### Personal Projects
- **Research Notes** - Track evolution of ideas and research
- **Writing Projects** - Manage drafts and revisions
- **Configuration Files** - Track changes to important configurations
- **Learning Materials** - Organize and version educational content

### Benefits for Educational Materials
- **Material Evolution** - Track how documentation and materials improve
- **Collaboration** - Multiple contributors can contribute
- **Rollback** - Revert problematic changes easily
- **Branching** - Experiment with different approaches

## Remote Repositories (GitHub, GitLab)

### Pushing and Pulling
```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Push changes to remote
git push origin main

# Pull changes from remote
git pull origin main

# Check remote status
git remote -v
```

### Collaboration Workflow
```bash
# Start working on new feature
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-material

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new documentation section"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-material

# Create pull request (on GitHub/GitLab)
# Review and merge through web interface
```

## Git for Configuration and Local-First Development

### Local Repository Benefits
- **Complete History** - Full project history available offline
- **Independence** - Work without internet connection
- **Privacy** - Repository can remain completely local
- **Backup** - Distributed nature provides natural backups

### Configuration Management
```bash
# Track application configurations
app-config/
├── .env.production
├── .env.development
├── docker-compose.yml
├── documentation/
│   ├── setup-guide.md
│   └── api-guide.md
└── troubleshooting/
    ├── common-issues.md
    └── solutions.md
```

### Version Control for Technical Projects
- **Configuration Files** - Track system and application configurations
- **Documentation** - Version control technical documentation
- **API Integrations** - Track API configuration changes
- **Setup Scripts** - Version control installation and setup procedures

## Advanced Git Concepts

### Merging vs Rebasing
```bash
# Merge (preserves branch history)
git merge feature-branch

# Rebase (linear history)
git rebase main
```

### Resolving Conflicts
```bash
# When merge conflicts occur
git status  # Shows conflicted files

# Edit files to resolve conflicts
# Look for markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>

# After resolving
git add resolved-file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

### Stashing Changes
```bash
# Temporarily store uncommitted changes
git stash

# Apply stashed changes
git stash pop

# List stashes
git stash list
```

## Git Security and Privacy

### Sensitive Information
```bash
# Never commit sensitive data
.env          # Contains API keys
passwords.txt # Contains passwords
private.key   # Contains private keys

# Use .gitignore file
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo "*.key" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore for sensitive files"
```

### Best Practices for Configuration Projects
- **Environment Files** - Never commit actual .env files with secrets
- **API Keys** - Use .env.example templates instead
- **Personal Data** - Don't commit personal documents
- **SSH Keys** - Keep authentication keys private

## Git Hosting Options

### GitHub
- **Most Popular** - Largest community
- **Free Tier** - Generous free plan
- **Features** - Issues, pull requests, actions
- **Integration** - Excellent third-party integration

### GitLab

- **GitKraken Glo** - Commercial self-hosted option
- **Sourcehut** - Minimalist, privacy-focused
- **Complete Control** - Own your code hosting

## Troubleshooting Common Git Issues

### Undoing Changes
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo changes to specific file
git checkout HEAD -- filename.txt

# Revert a commit (creates new commit)
git revert commit-hash
```

### Recovering Lost Work
```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Recover lost commit
git checkout lost-commit-hash
git branch recovery-branch
```

### Cleaning Up
```bash
# Remove untracked files
git clean -f

# Remove untracked files and directories
git clean -fd

# See what would be removed
git clean -n
```
