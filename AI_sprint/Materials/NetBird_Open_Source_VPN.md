# NetBird (Open Source VPN)

## What is NetBird?

**NetBird** is an open-source, WireGuard-based mesh VPN platform that creates secure, private networks connecting devices across different locations. It combines the performance of WireGuard with the ease of use of modern mesh networking solutions.

## NetBird Philosophy

### Open Source First
- **Fully Open Source** - Complete transparency in code and operations
- **Self-Hostable** - Run your own NetBird infrastructure
- **Community Driven** - Development guided by user needs
- **No Vendor Lock-in** - Complete control over your networking

### Privacy by Design
- **Zero Knowledge** - NetBird cannot see your network traffic
- **Local Control** - You manage your own networks and policies
- **Minimal Data Collection** - Only essential operational data stored
- **Transparent Operations** - All processes are documented and auditable

## How NetBird Works

### Architecture Overview
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         NetBird Network             │
│                                     │
│  Device A ←──────→ Device B         │
│      ↕               ↕              │
│  Device C ←──────→ Device D         │
│                                     │
│  (Direct WireGuard connections)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Components
- **NetBird Agent** - Runs on each device to manage connections
- **Management Server** - Coordinates network configuration
- **Signal Server** - Helps establish peer-to-peer connections
- **Relay Servers** - Fallback when direct connection impossible

### Connection Process
1. **Device Registration** - Device joins NetBird network
2. **Peer Discovery** - Find other devices in the network
3. **Connection Establishment** - Create direct WireGuard tunnels
4. **Traffic Routing** - Route network traffic through secure tunnels
